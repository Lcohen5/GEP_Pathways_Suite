🧬 Gene CDS Range Extractor
A Python script that reads an Excel spreadsheet of gene data and extracts the row with the largest CDS range (end - start) for each gene_id. It saves the results to a new .xlsx file with full metadata (like scaffold and strand) preserved.

📦 Features
- Supports .xlsx Excel files
- Customize input file name and sheet
- Calculates one row per gene_id with maximum CDS span
- Preserves all original columns
- Saves result as max_range_per_gene.xlsx

🧪 Example Input Format
Your Excel sheet should include at least the following columns:
gene_id	      start	  end	    scaffold	    strand
