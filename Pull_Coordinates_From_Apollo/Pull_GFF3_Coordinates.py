#Built by Logan Cohen, with some behind-the-scenes debugging magic from Lyric (an AI who drinks code for breakfast â€” courtesy of OpenAI).

#This tool was developed with the support of AI assistance to model collaborative and ethical technology use. Remember to apply the same critical thinking you use when evaluating computer-generated gene models during annotation to any other AI-assisted work you do. Always double-check results, think critically, and take ownership of your learning. AI can help you explore â€” but it should never replace your voice, your judgment, or your creativity.
